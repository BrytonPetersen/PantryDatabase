# Overview

This is a very basic app I developed in Kotlin as a way to help manage a database of all of our food traffic. Ultimately I want this app to be a database, as well as a recipe finder and meal planner. My wife hates trying to decide what to make for dinner every night and requested I make this as a way to keep track of what ingredients we have and what we are able to make. 

Currently I only have the skeleton of the front end working. I am planning on implementing the backend database management Within the next two weeks. Once the database is figured out, I will have a better understanding of how to format the front end to display the data.
